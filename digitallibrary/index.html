                        "Steelheart" by Brandon Sanderson is an exciting and inventive entry into the young adult
                        dystopian genre.
                        The story is set in a world where people with extraordinary powers, known as Epics, rule with an
                        iron fist,
                        and
                        the main character, David, is on a quest for revenge against one of the most powerful Epics of
                        all:
                        Steelheart.

                        Sanderson's writing is engaging, and his world-building is top-notch as he explores the
                        consequences of
                        superhuman
                        abilities in a gritty and dangerous setting. The story is filled with action, suspense, and a
                        touch of
                        humor, making
                        it a page-turner for readers of all ages. "Steelheart" is a fresh and original take on the
                        superhero genre,
                        and it's a
                        must-read for those who enjoy action-packed adventures and exploring the moral complexities of
                        power and
                        vengeance.

                        "The Fellowship of the Ring" By J.R.R. Tolkien 
                        The story follows the journey of Frodo Baggins and a diverse group of companions as they set out
                        to destroy
                        the One Ring, a malevolent artifact that could lead to the resurrection of the Dark Lord Sauron.
                        Their
                        mission
                        takes them to Mount Doom in Mordor, where the ring must be destroyed. Along the way, they face
                        an array of
                        challenges, including battles with orcs and internal conflicts, all while forging strong bonds
                        of friendship
                        and heroism.
