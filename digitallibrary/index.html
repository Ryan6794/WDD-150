                Steelheart is an exciting and inventive entry into the young adult
                dystopian genre.
                The story is set in a world where people with extraordinary powers, known as Epics, rule with an
                iron fist,
                and
                the main character, David, is on a quest for revenge against one of the most powerful Epics of
                all:
                Steelheart.

                Sanderson's writing is engaging, and his world-building is top-notch as he explores the
                consequences of
                superhuman
                abilities in a gritty and dangerous setting. The story is filled with action, suspense, and a
                touch of
                humor, making
                it a page-turner for readers of all ages. "Steelheart" is a fresh and original take on the
                superhero genre,
                and it's a
                must-read for those who enjoy action-packed adventures and exploring the moral complexities of
                power and
                vengeance.

                The Fellowship of the Ring follows the journey of Frodo Baggins and a diverse group of companions as
                they set out
                to destroy
                the One Ring, a malevolent artifact that could lead to the resurrection of the Dark Lord Sauron.
                Their
                mission
                takes them to Mount Doom in Mordor, where the ring must be destroyed. Along the way, they face
                an array of
                challenges, including battles with orcs and internal conflicts, all while forging strong bonds
                of friendship
                and heroism.
